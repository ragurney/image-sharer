Closes #X

---

The following is a checklist to remind you of the steps to take when opening a
new PR. The horizontal line above and everything below can be removed from the
pull request description.

- [ ] I have replaced `X` above with the associated issue number.
- [ ] I have changed the issue's label to "pull request".
- [ ] I have assigned the designated reviewer to this PR.
- [ ] I have set the appropriate label on this PR.
- [ ] I have written clear commit messages ([ref](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)).

If needed, please review the document on the
[Image Sharing Project](https://sites.google.com/a/appfolio.com/eng/new-hire-resources/engineering-academy/ropes/image-sharing-project)
for information on how labels should be used.
